# About

I am a Research Mathematical Statistician in the Center for Statistical Research and Methodology at the U.S. Census Bureau. I work in the [Missing Data and Observational Data Modeling Group](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research/expertise/missing-data.html), focusing on reducing bias due to non-response and missing data. I recieved my PhD in statistics from the University of Washington in June 2023. I was advised by [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/) at Stanford University and [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) at UW. 



Previously I was a [Fulbright Scholar](https://us.fulbrightonline.org) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu) and before that I received my BS in math from Arizona State University. <!-- I have worked with Yen-Chi Chen in the UW stats department and Clark Taylor at the Air Force Research Lab. --> At UW, I was supported by an [ARCS fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/national-homepage). 

At the Census Bureau and in graduate school, my work focuses on questions in causal inference, network analysis, and survey design. [A large part](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09881) of my research focuses on making large-scale surveys more accessible to researchers by making them cheaper, more accurate, and easier to run. I work on [model selection for network data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09702) and [learning geometric properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10559) of data to improve down-stream tasks in inference and machine learning. I develop user-friendly software that allows researchers to better understand their data. 

**A description of some related work by my advisor Tyler McCormick [recently appeared](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/you-probably-know-611-people-heres-how-we-know-88dd27d9) in the Wall Street Journal!**

# Research
My research covers a host of network and data science topics, and I work on causal inference, network analysis, and survey design. 

I am passionate about developing user-friendly and interpretable software that allows researchers to better understand and learn from data.

# Teaching
I am passionate about mentoring and teaching. See [here](./teaching.html) for more information.  -->
