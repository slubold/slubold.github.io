I am a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/). Previously, I received my BS in math from Arizona State University. I have worked with Yen-Chi Chen in the UW stats department and Clark Taylor at the Air Force Research Lab. I am supported by an [ARCS fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/national-homepage).


# Research
My research focuses on network data and models. I am interested in the relationship between network structure and underyling geometric structure. 
I like to use tools from random matrix theory to answer these types of questions.  I am particularly interested in partial network data, and I try to understand when this type of data is sufficient to do good statistical inference and estimation. I am also interested in understanding how to best conduct surveys for unobserved networks.

See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ab-RAckAAAAJ&hl=en) and [NBER profile](https://www.nber.org/people/shane_lubold?page=1&perPage=50) for an up-to-date list of publications.

## Teaching at UW

In the summer of 2021, I was the sole instructor for MATH/STAT 395: Probability II. 

I have served as the TA for the following courses:
- STAT 502: Design and Analysis of Experiments
- STAT/CSSS 567: Statistical analysis of social network data (Autumn 2020). 
- STAT 390 Statistical Methods in Engineering and Science (Spring 2019).
- STAT 421: Stat 421: Applied Statistics and Experimental Design (Autumn 2018).
