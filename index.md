# About

I am a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/). <!--Previously, I received my BS in math from Arizona State University. I have worked with Yen-Chi Chen in the UW stats department and Clark Taylor at the Air Force Research Lab. -->
I am supported by an [ARCS fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/national-homepage). 

**I am on the job market.** My expected graduation is June 2023.

# Research
My research covers a host of network and data science topics, and I work on causal inference, network analysis, and survey design. 

I am passionate about developing user-friendly and interpretable software that allows researchers to better understand and learn from data.

See [here](./research-publications.html) for more information on my research and recent publications.

# Teaching
I am passionate about mentoring and teaching. See [here](./teaching.html) for more information.  -->
