I am a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/). Previously, I received my BS in math from Arizona State University. I have worked with Yen-Chi Chen in the UW stats department and Clark Taylor at the Air Force Research Lab. I am supported by an [ARCS fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/national-homepage). 

**I am on the job market.** My expected graduation is June 2023. Here is my [CV](https://slubold.github.io/LuboldCV_V2.pdf).


# Research
My research covers a host of network and data science topics, motivated primarily by questions in demography, developmental economics, sociology, machine learning, and conservation efforts. I am passionate about working on high-impact problems in data science. See [here](./research-publications.html) for more information on my research and recent publications.
